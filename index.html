	<p><b><i> Daniel Greenberg</b></p>
	<p>	During my time as an intern at the NY Post I helped plan out their mobile application by working on the design of it. Moreover, I was able to use my basic HTML knowledge to perform some website management at the New American Cinema Group, Inc (http://film-makerscoop.com). At this position I also helped design advertisement such as bookmarks and posters through Adobe software. Also, I took a work-study job as an ITS lab consultant at Hamilton College, and through that I learned the ins and outs of programs such as Final Cut Pro and software packages such as Adobe CS5.</p>

	<p>	I love doing digital imaging and editing work, and I have fueled this through taking classes, doing videography and photography jobs, and learning as much as I can in my free time. This passion to develop my software skills has led to the desire to expand my technological horizons, and I know with my work ethic and determination I could develop these skills quickly and be one of your most valuable students. I have a passion for new technology and research as well, and in my free time I listen to technology podcasts and read related blogs and magazines, and it captivates my imagination and inspires me to pursue such tasks myself. I find computer science fascinating, and your school will enable me to channel my creative desire into a realm where great ideas can be fulfilled through programming. I have a lot of friends who work in the programming world, so I know how great the opportunities are out there and I want to enter this field because of it. That's why I'm so excited to be applying to Launch Academy.</p>
